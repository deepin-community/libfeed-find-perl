    - Added author tests (xt/) and modified SYNOPSIS for all modules to
      make them pass the compilation test.

0.06  2005.09.08
    - Added application/xml as a valid feed type, because certain

0.05  2005.01.08
    - Fixed bug where base URI would be unset if there was a <base>
      tag without an href attribute.

    - Added Feed::Find->find_in_html to perform the same auto-discovery
      on a chunk of HTML already in memory.

    - Feed::Find->find($url_of_feed) will now return $url_of_feed.
